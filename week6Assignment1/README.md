# Brain cells connectivity

## Topic

This assignment was about using pretty much everything that had been learned since the beginning of this course.
It was about a brain that contains different cells with many behavior such as getting a stimulation from another brain cell with the recoitStimulus() method.
Also the brain could create connection between its cells with the creerConnexion() method and then stimulate every single cell thanks to a *ad hoc* algorithm.

The only thing that was a bit fun in the end is to code this *ad hoc* algorithm.
