## Content

- On this repository, I will commit the code from exercises and assignements that I completed while taking the "Intro to OOP in Java" course on Coursera.

- This course introduces to all the basic topics of Object Oriented Programming such as objects and classes but quickly goes on to encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces and management of exceptions.

- I have seen many introduction courses to OOP in Java and I think this one is really the one that allowed me to understand those topics that are not always easy to get for beginner programers.
